# Rework health interface

## Pain points
- Backward compatibility
- Need to implement ALL of v1, v2
- Charger
- BatteryMonitor
- Legacy board healthd hooks

## Functionality
Implement:
- HealthConfig: like healthd_config, but we can just use the autogenerated
  header
  `struct healthd_config *mHealthdConfig;`
- Nothing
